# RailsDevelopmentBoost

Alternative to Josh Goebel's [`rails_dev_mode_performance`](https://github.com/yyyc514/rails_dev_mode_performance) plugin.

## Background

Why create a similar plugin? Because I couldn't get Josh Goebel's to work in my projects. His attempts to keep templates cached in a way that fails with recent versions of Rails. Also, removing the faulty chunk of code revealed another issue: it stats source files that may not exist, without trying to find their real path beforehand. That would be fixable is the code wasn't such a mess (no offense).

I needed better performance in development mode right away, so here is an alternative implementation.

## Usage

    script/plugin install git://github.com/Roman2K/rails-dev-boost

When the server is started in *development* mode, the special unloading mechanism takes over.
